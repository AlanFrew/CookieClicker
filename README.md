CookieClicker
=============

The popular game Cookie Clicker is about stocks and flows. You have an income (measured in cookies) and a bank. The objective is to increase your income as quickly as possible by using your bank to purchase cookie-producing buildings. This game calculates the fastest path to a particular achievement:
Bake 1 million total cookies (including those spent) in the shortest possible time. Upgrades are not considered as they
would not likely affect the outcome.
