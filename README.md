CookieClicker
=============

The popular game Cookie Clicker is about stocks and flows. You have an income (measured in cookies) and a bank. The objective is to increase your income as quickly as possible by using your bank to purchase cookie-producing buildings. This game calculates the fastest path to a particular achievement:
Bake 1 million total cookies (including those spent) in the shortest possible time. Upgrades are not considered as they
would not likely affect the outcome.

You can play the game yourself at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
